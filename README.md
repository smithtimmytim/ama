### About Me

I'm [Tim Smith](https://ttimsmith.com/), a frontend designer from Saint Paul, MN. I design and build web applications. I made a podcasting CMS (Content Management System) that powers [Goodstuff FM](http://goodstuff.fm/) and [Relay FM](http://relay.fm/), together with [Phil Duffy](https://twitter.com/willmanduffy). After work, I spend time with my wife, read comics, watch movies, and write [*The Bold Report*](http://theboldreport.net/).

### Asking a Question

Anything means *anything*. I'm an open book. Life, work, comics, code, design, remote teams, etc.

Once I answer I'll close the issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worryâ€”if you have any further questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

When you create a new issue:

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Be civil and polite.
